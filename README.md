INTRODUCTION:
My project will attempt to use the tools of Data Science to characterize the attitudes of a war-time American President. 

It will do this through analysis of Presidential Inaugural Speeches - constructed statements of each President’s vision for the United States’ role in the world, and arguably the most important indicator for what is to come in their term. 

I chose this area of focus for my project because I hypothesize that the United States’ historical ventures into war can be traced to the aggressive attitudes held by the Commander-in-Chief of America’s Armed Forces, as expressed through their foreign policy, but more importantly, as represented in the tone and content of their inaugural speeches.

I believe I will discover noticeable trends in the topics evoked and sentiments employed by the War Presidents, that will stand in contrast to the Presidents of Peacetime. 



ABSTRACT OF FINDINGS:
- The Inaugural Speeches of War-time Presidents have a higher discernible presence of negative emotion.
- The War-time Presidents also contain more sentences of "disgust" and "sadness" in their Inaugural Speeches
- Along these same lines, perhaps unsurprisingly, Peace-time Presidents have a significantly more noticeable presence of the positive emotions: Joy, Anticipation, and Trust
